# Monte-Carlo-Integral
Simple Application to Calculate Integral with Monte-Carlo methods this methods use Probabilistic Approximation to calculate Integral

First Version Note 
- This Only Calculate Func = X so if you want change the function you can change the function func(x)
- This project don't produce output (Still on Process)

Hope your Enjoy 
FYI you need to Import Numpy,Math Library
